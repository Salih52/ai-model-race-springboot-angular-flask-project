Welcome to AilabRace! AilabRace is a platform where users can test different types of AI models against other users. After registering in the system, you can join a competition. In the competition, you train your model with the provided dataset and then upload it to the system. The system tests your uploaded model on the dataset provided for the competition. Scores vary based on the type of competition. For example, success in classification competitions is measured by accuracy (accuracy rate), while success in regression competitions is evaluated by the RÂ² score. After the competition is completed, you can see the scores you have achieved and access other related metrics. Admin users have additional permissions such as creating, editing, and viewing the results of the competitions.
